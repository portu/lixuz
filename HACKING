Hacking on and contributing to the Lixuz CMS
============================================

Hacking and coding style
------------------------
Lixuz follows some simple rules on coding style, which is used throughout in
both JavaScript and Perl:
- Spaces, not tabs
- Four spaces per indentation-level
- Braces on their own line
    sub method
    {
    }
        not:
    sub method {
    }


Code documentation
------------------
Comments (and in some cases embedded POD) document the individual modules and
classes. To get an overview of the architecture of Lixuz, see
docs/technical/architecture.pod. Additional documentation, such as on the
template format, installation instructions etc. can also be found in the docs
subdirectory.

Submitting contributions
------------------------
Contributions can easily be submitted by opening a pull request on GitHub.
The official GitHub repository is located at https://github.com/portu/lixuz

Development environment setup
-----------------------------

    Perl-modules
    ------------
First you'll need to install the perl modules that Lixuz depends upon.
The easiest way to do that is to run:
    perl DEPSLIST list | cpanm
from the toplevel directory. Adjust cpanm parameters for local::lib etc. as needed.

    Bootstrapping
    -------------
You will need a dump from a live Lixuz database to bootstrap the database from,
as there's currently no easy way to get one up from scratch (that's not to say
it's impossible, it just requires a lot of fiddling by manually adding users).
The Lixuz installer handles all of this, so you may just use
./script/lixuz_install.pl to install to a temporary directory. Then you can
copy lixuz.yml from the temporary directory and then delete it. Once that is
done you can use ./script/lixuz_server.pl to start a development server.
